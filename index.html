<p>The average number of electronic devices used in everyday and professional life is increasing. With this increasing number of heterogenous devices the application model of a user sitting in front of one device to achieve a task is outdated. Even less so for team situations. A user should be able to make use of each device’s capabilities to increase his productivity. While data manipulation is feasible on a laptop, detailed consumption is most efficient on a tablet, the display of large data makes most sense on a TV and team collaboration works best on a touch table. To make use of these capabilities, applications need to be able to interact with each other across devices. As current available approaches are either proprietary, focused on a single task or too difficult (see <a href="#challenges-of-device-interaction">chapter 1.2.3</a>) this thesis presents a general approach that allows developers to easily create interacting applications using standardized web technologies and the REST architecture style.</p>
<p>Even though there are many possible applications (see <a href="#application-scenarios">chapter 1.2.2</a>) research is currently not investigating the possibility of creating an open general solution for interacting applications as seen in <a href="#related-work">chapter 2</a>. To reduce the necessary design and development time of interacting applications this thesis will contribute an open source framework enabling Device Interaction [DI] called IntAirAct.</p>
<p>It is crucial that the framework uses open standards. This not only reduces the design and implementation time of the framework but also ensures cross-platform compatibility.</p>
<p>Due to the ubiquity of the Internet there are many frameworks and implementations for all major platforms available that use standardized web technologies (e.g. HTTP or JSON). Especially for communication on mobile devices web technologies are widely used. This makes them an ideal candidate for the communication layer. As will be seen (see chapter <strong>chapter</strong>) the architecture style REST is also feasible for DI.</p>
<p>To overview the structure of this thesis: First the <a href="#requirements">requirements</a> of the framework will be investigated followed by the <a href="#design">design</a> of it. Secondly it will be <a href="#implementation">implemented</a> for two major platforms: iOS/OS X and C#. Finally the framework will be <a href="#evaluation">evaluated</a>.</p>
<p>This chapter will continue to cover the background necessary to understand the contributions of this thesis. First DI will be formally defined followed by the major challenges when trying to create interacting applications. Research questions and goals are also stated.</p>
<h2 id="device-interaction"><a href="#TOC">1.1 Device Interaction</a></h2>
<p>First it is necessary to define what this thesis understands as DI. The definition is then supported and the usefulness of DI motivated by presenting three example applications.</p>
<h3 id="definition"><a href="#TOC">1.1.1 Definition</a></h3>
<p>Interaction is defined as “a mutual or reciprocal action or influence”.<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></span> This definition can be extended to serve the purposes of this thesis:</p>
<p><strong>Device Interaction is a mutual or reciprocal action or influence between devices.</strong></p>
<p>To understand the entirety of the definition the parts of it will be defined in more detail.</p>
<p>First of all it is necessary to understand the term device. A <em>device</em> is any electronic device. This includes - but is not restricted to - smartphones, tablets, computers and touch tables.</p>
<p>Next it is important to understand what is happening between these devices. An <em>action</em> or <em>influence</em> is the ability of a device to access and/or change the state of another device.</p>
<p>The notion of <em>mutual</em> or <em>reciprocal</em> means that the actions can be exchanged bi-directionally between the devices.</p>
<p>In sum this means that all devices have the ability to access and/or change the state of all the other devices. Thus allowing applications to cross the boundaries of a single-device.</p>
<p>In order to concretize the definition the next chapter presents three example applications.</p>
<h3 id="example-applications"><a href="#TOC">1.1.2 Example applications</a></h3>
<p>This chapter will present two existing proprietary applications that fall under the definition of Device Interaction. As far as known and relevant implementation details will be explained. Finally the project for which IntAirAct was created will be presented.</p>
<h4 id="remote-for-ios"><a href="#TOC">1.1.2.1 Remote for iOS</a></h4>
<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/remote/">Remote for iOS</a> is an application that allows the remote control of a media player<sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> running on a desktop computer using a mobile device<sup><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/itunes-remote.png" alt="A screenshot of Remote for iPad" /><p class="caption">A screenshot of Remote for iPad</p>
</div>
<p>This example demonstrates the bi-directional nature of device interaction: while the mobile device displays information from the desktop computer (e.g. the available songs) the mobile device controls the desktop computer (e.g. play this song). The protocol used<sup><a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4">4</a></sup> is proprietary but has been partly <a href="http://dacp.jsharkey.org/">reverse engineered</a>. The system uses the HTTP protocol for requests and a binary protocol for the responses.</p>
<h4 id="bump"><a href="#TOC">1.1.2.2 Bump</a></h4>
<p><a href="https://bu.mp/">Bump</a> is an application that allows the exchange of information between devices using a shake gesture.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/bump.png" alt="Bump being used to exchange contact information" /><p class="caption">Bump being used to exchange contact information</p>
</div>
<p>This example demonstrates the technological issues of interacting applications. Bump uses an Internet connection to transfer data between two devices that are in close vicinity. This is very inefficient as the data has to move from the devices to a server and back.</p>
<h4 id="multi-surface-environment-api"><a href="#TOC">1.1.2.3 Multi-Surface Environment API</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Describe MSE and what we want to achieve in the lab. Quote the Multi-Surface papers from Chris and Teddy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This example is the use-case for which IntAirAct</p>
<p>This example is an application scenario in which IntAirAct is supposed to be used. Therefore this chapter will merely describe the goals of the API.</p>
<p>The goal of the API is to allow gesture based interactions between multiple devices in a room.</p>

<p>what would a developer have to do now to create interacting applications? What would his biggest challenges be? How about I use a persona to achieve this?</p>

<h3 id="knowledge"><a href="#TOC">1.2.1 Knowledge</a></h3>
<h2 id="research-questions"><a href="#TOC">1.3 Research questions</a></h2>
<p>This thesis presents a new approach for device communication that allows interacting applications.</p>
<p>Given the fact that the architecture is not implemented for all major platforms: 1. Is it possible to be implemented on all major platforms?</p>
<p>Since bi-directional communication requires a web server running on all devices on of the research questions is: 1. Is it possible to have web servers on mobile devices?</p>
<p>Since web technologies have been created for long-distance high-latency communication they include overhead that is not necessary in local-area scenarios. Thus the performance of the framework has to be evaluated: 2. Is the performance sufficient?</p>
<h2 id="goals"><a href="#TOC">1.4 Goals</a></h2>
<p>There are two main goals of this thesis. The first is to design an architecture for Device Interaction [DI]. The second is to implement the stack in form of a framework. The third goal is to attempt to answer the research questions listed above to show that the approach followed while developing the framework is feasible for creating interacting applications.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#TOC">1.5 Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>In this chapter an approach for Device Interaction using web technologies is presented. Device Interaction was defined and examples were presented. Major challenges when trying Finally, the research questions that will be investigated and the goals of this thesis were stated.</p>

<p>In this section I briefly present some of the research literature related to device communication.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since I don’t have that many papers about related stuff I first explain the main problem: Then I write that there is nothing that does what I do. GameKit kind of does what I need but it’s iOS only. Thus I explain parts of what I will achieve and for that I can then go through related work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is kind of lost here? I think this should move under Related Work, or?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What is REST for me? This might actually fit under Related Work too… The idea is to use web technologies. In the web there are lots of architecture styles available for APIs. REST is the most popular one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I understand it rather as the REST API than the architecture style described by Fielding [quote dissertation].</p>
<h1 id="requirements"><a href="#TOC">3 Requirements</a></h1>

<p>I think it makes sense to distinguish between architecture and framework. The general architecture has different requirements than the actual implementations.</p>

<p>This is essentially the same as the requirements of a MOM. Look at them from Schulze.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="communication"><a href="#TOC">Communication</a></h4>
<p>The communication is a fundamental part of the architecture. It has to allow for peer-to-peer communication to allow direct interactions of the devices without a middleman. The communication has to be bi-directional to allow true exchange between the devices.</p>
<h4 id="device-discovery"><a href="#TOC">Device discovery</a></h4>
<p>To enable Ad-Hoc interaction scenarios it is essential that the devices can discover each other without requiring infrastructure in the sense of an internet connection or a setup server. The devices should be able to discover each other without a middleman. This reduces set-up cost and allows for use in many everyday situations like a coffeeshop.</p>
<h4 id="addressing-scheme"><a href="#TOC">Addressing Scheme</a></h4>
<p>It is necessary to uniquely identify devices in the network of devices to allow for direct communication.</p>
<h4 id="resource"><a href="#TOC">Resource</a></h4>
<p>The basis of the architecture is to be able to share resources (images, documents) between devices. The architecture should define how these resources are identified.</p>
<h4 id="cross-platform-compatibility"><a href="#TOC">Cross-platform compatibility</a></h4>
<p>One of the goals is to support all modern devices. Here is a list of the devices that are meant by “modern device”. Additionally all the Operating Systems are listed as well as the programming languages that have to be supported by the framework. This means that the technologies used have to be compatible with the majority of these platforms.</p>

<h4 id="performance"><a href="#TOC">Performance</a></h4>
<p>To allow natural interactions between the devices the architecture has to deliver sufficient performance to not distract the user. The 100ms boundary introduced by <span class="citation">Robert B. Miller<sup><a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5">5</a></sup></span> should be sufficient. To allow for situations like congestion, etc. the goal of the architecture is 10ms / message.</p>
