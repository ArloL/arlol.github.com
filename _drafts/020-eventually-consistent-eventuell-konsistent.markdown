title: Eventually consistent is not eventuell konsistent
description: "Eventually consistent is a bad choice of words for Germans since gut feeling leads to a bad translation."

For Germans *eventually consistent* seems like the exact opposite of what it means. If we look at the word *eventually* we quickly translate it to *eventuell*. But that is completely wrong. *Eventually* means *irgendwann* and *eventuell* means *maybe*. It's a statement about time not about possibility. *Eventual consistency* guarantees consistency.

Thanks to [Uwe Friedrichsen](https://twitter.com/ufried) for pointing this out in his talk [Unkaputtbar - Muster f√ºr Resilient Software Design]().
