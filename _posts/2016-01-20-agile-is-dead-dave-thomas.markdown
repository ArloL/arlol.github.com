I came across this really good talk by [Dave Thomas](http://pragdave.me/) on [Daily Tech Video](http://dailytechvideo.com/). He is one of the original authors of the [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/). He describes his problems with the industry that popped up around the term *Agile* and what developers can do about it. The talk is [Agile is Dead by Pragmatic Dave Thomas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-BOSpxYJ9M).
