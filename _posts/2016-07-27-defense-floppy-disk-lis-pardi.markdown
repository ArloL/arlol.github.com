title: In Defense of the Floppy Disk by Lis Pardi
description: An interesting talk about two surveys Lis did about icons and their meanings.

I found this talk in a [comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12164866) by [larsiusprime](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=larsiusprime) in the comment section of a [Hacker News post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12164021). Lis Pardi did a survey on whether people of certain age groups can identify icons that reference old objects such as the floppy disk. I found the data pretty interesting (majority can identify successfully) and her arguments that try to explain it are sound (context gives meaning).

The talk is [In Defense of the Floppy Disk by Lis Pardi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kylikelQBqg).
