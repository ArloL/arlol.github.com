I came across this talk by Mary Shaw in a [comment by xjay](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11046657) on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). She is a researcher on software architecture at Carnegie Mellon University. In it she first describes the history of civil engineering. She then compares it to the history and current state of software engineering. The talk is [Progress Toward an Engineering Discipline of Software by Mary Shaw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLnsi522LS8).

Seeing the history of civil engineering was interesting. She used the example of bridges. It started with a long period of trial and error. After some major catastrophes involving the collapse of bridges successful bridges were analyzed. That resulted in best practices and design guidelines. These were tested and confirmed using scientific methods. And today there is software that can [design bridges](http://bradd.engrprograms.com/home/) for you.
