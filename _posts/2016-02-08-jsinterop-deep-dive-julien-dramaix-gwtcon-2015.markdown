I found this talk on the [GWT con YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOdt_KILYgeDlhc48kIV00g). [Julien Dramaix](https://twitter.com/jDramaix) works at Google and is part of the [GWT project](http://www.gwtproject.org/). JsInterop is the new GWT API for interaction with native JavaScript. He describes the usage on the Java side and on the JavaScript side. The talk is [JsInterop Deep Dive by Julien Dramaix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxHktS3SSnQ).
