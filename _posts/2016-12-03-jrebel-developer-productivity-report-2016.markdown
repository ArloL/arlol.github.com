title: RebelLabs Developer Productivity Report 2016
description: Java Tools and Technologies Landscape

RebelLabs by ZeroTurnaround (the company behind JRebel) does a yearly
developer survey. And it is always accompanied by great write-ups. This time
they wrote three blog posts:

*   [Part 1: Looking at the raw data](http://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/java-tools-and-technologies-landscape-2016/)
*   [Part 2: Pivoting the data](http://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/java-tools-and-technologies-landscape-2016-pivoting-data/): microservices usage, early vs. late adopters, and so on
*   [Part 3: Looking at trends and the historical data](http://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/java-tools-and-technologies-landscape-2016-trends/)

I like these kind of reports since they give you a birds-eye view of the
"vocal" community. "Vocal" community in the sense of people that fill out
surveys. So always take these reports with a grain of salt. Use the trends
as a guideline on what you should checkout rather than what you have to adopt.
